Swap out use of entities as their own identifier for an id for each entity, weapon or such, and make an entity look up system possibly if needed


look up collision optimization things like quadtree
probably overkill given the simple cell system as of now but whatever, fun to research later even if i don't implement it, but might implement for fun/learning

hurry up and consolidate entity manager and player manager
